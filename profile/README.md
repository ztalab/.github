ZTATAB is a research and open source organization for zero trust architecture. Currently in the initial stage, we will gradually open source the projects we have incubated and ongoing projects to make our contribution to the zero-trust ecosystem. If you are also interested, or have any suggestions, please let us know and let us know. Let's work together to promote the construction of a zero-trust ecosystem.

### Contributing to the ecosystem

- **CA** - Zero Trust CA Certificate System
- **ZAsentinel** - Zero Trust Software Defined Boundary SDP System
